--In this project, I downloaded the spotify data from Kaggle, created a table in SQLite Studio, and then added the data into the table.
--I performed analytics on the data using SQL

--This is creating the table

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal (4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal (4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal (5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal (5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal (6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal (5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal (4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal (6,3) NOT NULL,
duration integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

--I proceeded to insert the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

--Next, I used SQL to explore the data

--I wanted to see the average popularity, danceability, and loudness by artist and tracks.
SELECT artist_name,
track_name,
AVG(popularity),
AVG(danceability),
AVG(loudness)
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name
;

--I want to see who the top ten artists are on spotify based on their popularity
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;
